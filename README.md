# GeneticAlgorithms_Rastrigin_SAHC

Implementation of a Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing iterated improvement algorithm as an early project for genetic algorithms using a version of the Rastrigin function for fitness and fitness landscape.

The iterations stop when none of the neighbours offer a valid adcent route.
